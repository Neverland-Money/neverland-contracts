Neverland Contracts – Licensing Overview
=======================================
This repository contains Neverland-authored contracts alongside vendored upstream code. SPDX identifiers in each file remain authoritative; this document summarizes how licenses apply across the tree.

Primary license for Neverland-authored code
-------------------------------------------
- Unless a file states otherwise, Neverland-authored contracts, scripts, tests, and docs in `src/`, `script/`, and `test/` are provided under the Business Source License 1.1 with the parameters below.

Exceptions and copyleft components
----------------------------------
- GNU GPL-3.0-or-later: `src/utils/NeverlandDustHelper.sol` imports @uniswap/v2-core (GPL-3.0) and @uniswap/v3-core interfaces (GPL-2.0-or-later after the Change Date).
- GNU AGPL-3.0: `src/emissions/DustTransferStrategyBase.sol`, `src/emissions/DustLockTransferStrategy.sol`, `src/emissions/DustRewardsController.sol`, `src/interfaces/IDustTransferStrategy.sol`, `src/interfaces/IDustRewardsController.sol`, and `src/interfaces/IDustLockTransferStrategy.sol` are derived from or extend Aave v3 code.
- MIT (Neverland-authored): `src/interfaces/IUserVaultRegistry.sol` and test harnesses/contracts in `test/`.

Vendored dependencies (retain their upstream licenses)
